我从来没有系统的学习过画画，可是我喜欢画画。代码，绘画都是创作的过程，人类创造的快乐估计和上帝创造万物时一样吧。我的这些乱涂乱画有些是心情烦闷时的抒发，有些是面对困顿、虚无时的自我鼓励。无论本质是否存在，是上帝既定好的，或是要人们通过实践而得出的，艺术一定是在通往本质的路上最好的安慰。也许我们一生都无法达到理想，可是我们自由创造的一切，都是我们对本质的真切回应！

I've never systematically learned how to draw, but I love painting. Coding and painting are both acts of creation—perhaps the joy of human creation is akin to the joy God felt when creating the world. Some of my doodles are expressions of frustration, while others are self-encouragement in the face of hardship and nihilism. Regardless of whether essence exists—whether it is predetermined by God or something we must discover through practice—art is surely the greatest solace on the journey toward it. Perhaps we may never reach the ideal in our lifetime, but everything we freely create is our genuine response to the essence of things!
